# Random-Number-Generator
# This is a random number generator tool that generates random number between (1-100) every x seconds. User inputs for x. Used for mixing decisions in fast fold online poker.
# Eg. BTN opens 2.5x and you're in the BB with pocket 99s, GTOWizard recommends 3betting 40% of the time and calling the rest. Using the RNG tool, the number generated will be used to determine the action we take.
